Sfx2Sirsi 3.0.

In trying to refactor and clean up (add tests) to sfx2sirsi 2, it became
clear that much of the logic is no longer necessary (if it ever was).
All sfx2sirsi now does is produce an output file containing object id,
issn, eissn, and open url, with a correct summary holdings statement.
Starting backwards from the required output, I'm rewriting/redesigning
sfx2sirsi to not do too much.
